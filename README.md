# Async-Await
Promises were discovered to solve the problem of callback hell, which is a situation where multiple asynchronous operations are nested inside each other, making it difficult to read and maintain the code. Promises provide a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and maintainable way.

Async/await is a newer syntax introduced in ES2017 that provides a more concise and readable way to work with promises. Async/await is built on top of promises and provides a way to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code.

Here's an example that demonstrates how async/await is better than promise.then design pattern:
